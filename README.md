# SherlockNet
Language Model for generating Sherlock Holmes stories based on RNN trained on tokens encoded using Byte Pair Encoding (BPE) algorithm.

Data collected from: https://www.kaggle.com/idevji1/sherlock-holmes-stories

### Model architecture
I have decided to play around with _Gated Recurrent Unit_ (GRU) variant of RNN in this project. I applied bidirectional cell of GRU to represent text. Then output of both cells is concatenated and passed through output layer to map _2 x GRU_CELL_DIM_ into vocabulary dimension. Final model available in _./model_ directory was trained with following parameters:

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Story window  | 16  |
| Embedding dimension  |  512 |
| GRU hidden dimension  |  1028 |
